    <h4>Course Work, 2019</h4>
          <div class="paragraph">

            <img src="p2p.jpg"; width="100%"; height="auto">
            <p>This project was completed over the course of 9 weeks during the Spring 2019 quarter
              as part of an undergraduate class in Human Centered Design and Engineering at the
              University of Washington. My group and I selected international students at UW who speak
              English as their second language to be our user group because we felt that the difficulties
              that some international students encounter were not adequately handled or given enough attention by the university.
              In order to approach and combat these issues, our team went through research, design,
              and prototyping to come up with a solution for our user group.</p>
              <h5>RESEARCH PHASE</h5>
          <p style="margin-block-start: .5em">Our research phase consisted of many different elements and methods.
            We first conducted semi-structured interviews, as well as contextual inquiry observational research.
            This enabled us to create personas as well as a user experience journey map.
            Our research allowed us to better understand our user group as well as identify pain points and eventually a design problem.</p>
            <h5><i>interviews</i></h5>
            <p style="margin-block-start: .5em">Each group member interviewed at
              least one potential user to better understand their needs and pain points as
              undergraduate international students at University of Washington whose second
              language is English.</p>
              <p style="margin-block-start: .5em; font-weight: lighter">Interview 1: Interviewee 1 is a 20 year old female international student at
              University of Washington. She is majoring in Human Centered design and Engineering
              and is originally from Shenzhen, China. Her first languages are Mandarin and
              Cantonese, and she began learning English in Elementary school. Her first time being
              completely immersed in an English speaking country was when she first came to the
              University of Washington.
              <br></br>
              Interview 2: Interviewee 2 is a 21 year old male. He is an international
              student at the University of Washington studying interaction design. He moved to the
              United States 4 years ago from China. He began learning English in Elementary school.
              Before moving to the US, he studied reading and writing but there was not something to
              prepare him for everyday life conversations. In academic setting, he struggles the most
              with formal writing in English.
              <br></br>
              Interview 3: Interviewee 3 is a 21 year old male. He is a 3rd year
              international student at the University of Washington studying Environmental Science.
              He is originally from the Philippines and his first language is Tagalog. He begun learning
              English at the age of 6. He came to the United States three years ago. He knows
              English very well in an academic setting, but struggles with English in a social setting.
              <br></br>
              Interview 4: Interviewee 4 is a 19 year old female. She is an international
              student at the University of Washington. She is now a freshman who started to learn
              English since high school, and both of her parents can’t speak English.</p>

            <h5>USER PERSONAS</h5>
             <p style="margin-block-start: .5em">After conducting our interviews and observations we developed two user personas for our user group.
               Pain points, commonalities, and scenarios identified in our interviews and observational study were merged together to build our user personas.
               These personas were created to represent the ideal user for our solution,
               they were used to build our user journey map and throughout the design process. </p>

            <img src="persona2.jpg"; width="105%"; height="auto">
             <h5>USER JOURNEY MAP</h5>
             <p style="margin-block-start: .5em">
            User journey map is a visualization of user experience based on what we currently know about our users through interviews and a contextual inquiry observation.
            We decided to do our journey map based on Jessica’s scenario and her difficulties in going to tutoring sessions for help in formal English writing. We realized
            that these pain points are what most of our interviewees have mentioned. The journey map has helped us focus on our users touch-points and emotions so later we
            understand better who we are designing for. The main takeaway that we got from our user journey map is that scheduling is an important factor that we should
            include in our design.  </p>
            <img src="userjourney.jpg"; width="105%"; height="auto">
            <h5>DESIGN REQUIREMENTS</h5>
            <p style="margin-block-start: .5em">
           Based on our previous research, we started to develop design requirements to determine what our platform should
           include in order to meet our users’ needs. These requirements led us define what features we wanted to include in our platform</p>
           <p style="margin-block-start: .5em; font-weight: lighter">
            <i>Requirements:</i>
            <br>
            Inclusive: International students are able to change the language settings
            <br></br>
            Intuitive: Easy to navigate around the pages and find what users are looking for. Includes a search bar and filtering options.
            <br></br>
            Inviting: Aesthetically pleasing so international students feel more comfortable interacting with platform.
            <br></br>
            Personalized: Users are able to create their own profile page and add information about themselves.
          </p>
          <h5>STORYBOARDS</h5>
          <p style="margin-block-start: .5em">
         Storyboards are used to show an experience or interaction using narrative and images. Each of our group members individually created two storyboard to convey different  stories and experiences of our international student users in their academic career. These storyboards have helped us think of various design solutions and come up with the main features that we would like to include in our platform.</p>
         <h5><i>my storyboard</i></h5>
         <p style="margin-block-start: .5em">How might we create a more efficient and effective peer tutoring system for international
          students to receive help on essays and academic writing assignments? This concept incorporates
          specifically tailored peer support as well as video chat and googledocs compatibility.</p>
          <img src="story.jpg"; width="105%"; height="auto">
          <h5>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h5>
         <p style="margin-block-start: .5em">Information architecture diagram is a tool used to organize all components of a system to show the hierarchical relationship between those components. We used the diagram to connect all the features we wanted to include and to show the flow of the screens. At this stage, we realized that we would like to have separated user dashboards for ESL international students and peer helpers. We then included both user paths in our paper prototype.</p>
        <p><a href="infoarch.pdf" download target="_blank">view info arch</a></p>
        <h5>PAPER PROTOTYPE</h5>
       <p style="margin-block-start: .5em">Paper prototypes are used to quickly sketch design ideas and test with potential users. This process has helped us determine the three main tasks of both our ESL students and peer helpers and then design the use interface for each task based on the previous information architecture.</p>
      <p><a href="paper.pdf" download target="_blank">view document</a></p>
      <h5>EVALUATION</h5>
     <p style="margin-block-start: .5em">Using our paper prototype, we conducted user testing with potential users to test our three tasks to get their insights toward the experience . Based on what the potential users said, we made revisions to the design. These revisions were then showed on the annotated wire-frames which were higher fidelity then the paper prototypes.</p>
    <p><a href="eval.pdf" download target="_blank">view document</a></p>
    <h5>ANNOTATED WIREFRAMES</h5>
   <p style="margin-block-start: .5em">According to the information architecture and the suggestions we got in the usability tests, we create our annotated wire-frames, which gives an overview of the functionality of our whole system, along with the annotations and transition diagram of the screen. With this, we finally determine the main pages for our high-fidelity mock-up.</p>
  <p><a href="annotated.pdf" download target="_blank">view wireframes</a></p>
  <h5>HIGH-FIDELITY MOCK-UP</h5>
 <p style="margin-block-start: .5em">We create the high-fidelity mock-up to finalize our design. After the annotated wire-frame, we decide to focus on the student users’ dashboard, so we create the user interface of student’s homepage, requesting page, live session and “My Session” page.</p>
